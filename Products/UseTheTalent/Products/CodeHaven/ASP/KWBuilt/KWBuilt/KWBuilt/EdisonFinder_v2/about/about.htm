			<h1>About Company</h1>
			<p>If you think there are ways to bring ideas to life, name them. 
			Most of the advertisements for &quot;Inventor&#39;s Wanted&quot; belong to 
			predatory scam companies’ intent on manipulation of a person&#39;s 
			ignorance of the patent process. Another chunk of invention lookers 
			belongs to patent troll companies. <br />
			<br />
			There are two main schools of thought for any would be &quot;<st1:place>Edison</st1:place>&quot;. 
			The idea pushed most often is to take your best idea and to spend 
			time and money on getting a patent, marketing it, prototyping, etc. 
			And if you are lucky, you might see a chance of success from the 
			thousands of dollars you spent on it. Stats thrown around carelessly 
			are commonly claiming a 2-3% success rate for this method. I tried 
			that for years and found it frustrating (especially with no money). 
			Lo and behold, a few books and dozens of websites later I find the 
			book
			<a href="http://www.frompatenttoprofit.com/" target="_blank" title="">
			From Patent to Profit</a> and things start clicking. This has book 
			lead me to the other school of thought (the one this site is based 
			on). This wild idea is to network with people who have connections 
			(manufacturing, etc.) and experience in the area of the idea. To 
			back it up, look at Eli Whitney, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham 
			Bell, George Washington Carver, etc. None of them invented &quot;One&quot; 
			great idea, they did far more. This second method also answers a 
			problem I had for years with the other method. Namely, if I have 
			lots of ideas, how do I know which one is the best one?<br />
			<br />
			Problem solved! </p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since I was 
			little, I&#39;ve had a unquenchable thirst for knowledge and an 
			unstoppable curiosity for how everything works. I first tried to 
			pursue an invention when I was a teenager. I never sent anything off 
			to the company I contacted. I entered college with the goal of being 
			a creative force in the world of Engineering. More specifically, I 
			entered into Mechanical Engineering at WSU in </span><st1:place><st1:city>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pullman</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
			</span><st1:state>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">WA</span></st1:state></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
			Much to my dismay, I learned that my curiosity, mechanical aptitude, 
			and hands on approach to designing and building were in the wrong 
			place. I could find few people calling themselves engineers that 
			worked on their own cars and like to build things or take items 
			apart to discover their inner workings. I was truly shocked to learn 
			that the majority of companies have you sign agreements that sign 
			over all intellectual property you create while working there. The 
			other part I found annoying was that one doesn&#39;t get to work 
			anything hands on until the Junior and Senior level. After 2 years I 
			went into computer science in order to make money doing something I 
			already had ability to do.<br />
			<br />
			To back track a little.... I was 20 (second year at college) and 
			submitted a very good idea to Invention Submission Corporation and 
			got the whole &quot;It&#39;s the greatest thing since sliced bread!&quot; routine. 
			I spent $688 for the next step, but fortunately failed to gather the 
			$10,000&nbsp; (during my 3rd year in college, but at </span><st1:place><st1:placename>

			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Basin</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">
			</span><st1:placetype>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">College</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
			in </span><st1:place><st1:city>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pasco</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">,

			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">WA</span></st1:state></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">) 
			asked to paid for the final step. I would have still been paying 
			that back to this day.<br />
			<br />
			I have devoured books, websites, and insites on inventing, 
			patenting, etc. The best book I&#39;ve had was written by Bob Demattis 
			called <i>Patent to Profit</i>.&nbsp; From his suggestions I got so 
			much further than I had previously. I found out that the idea of not 
			saying a peep to anyone is moronic. I spoke to engineers (of many 
			disciplines), doctors, dentists, teachers, consumers, and anyone 
			interested in giving their opinion on an idea. Some of the ideas 
			were great-I probably discussed over 100 different patentable ideas 
			while living in the Tri-Cites area, but none of them had any 
			connections to further the idea. I even met some patent holders. I 
			kept at it, though I was at the same time trying to move to a larger 
			city with more resources. My best advice came from Mr. Henderson of 
			Nuvotec (they specialize in dealing with nuclear waste) when I asked 
			if I should try in the </span><st1:city><st1:place>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Portland</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
			area, to which he replied, &quot;Yes, that would be a much better place.&quot; 
			I tried to transfer through Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s, </span><st1:city><st1:place>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ferguson</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
			and finally got it with Fred Meyer (it was part-time mind you!). I 
			met with poor managment at thoses locations and found out some 
			people without ethics sometimes have management titles.<br />
			<br />
			I moved to </span><st1:place><st1:city>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hillsboro</span></st1:city><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
			</span><st1:state>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">OR</span></st1:state></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
			on </span><st1:date year="2005" day="1" month="9">
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 1, 
			2005</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
			A few months of searching got me connected to the newly formed 
			Portland Inventors Group. Though, I did not find too much help in 
			this group (still outstanding people). Many of them are part of the 
			one-idea-and-lots-of-time-and-money school of thought. I am of the 
			network first school of thought. When I mentioned the idea of a 
			website for inventors by inventors, I found some liked it, but no 
			one was interested in making it. I held off on it until I found 
			www.DreamstoMarket.com and got inspired. At first I tried to contact 
			the site owner, but the e-mails went unanswered. Further study found 
			the flaws of having open membership. I concluded that the site needs 
			to be local only to keep costs much lower. Also, it should have a 
			membership set up so that only those that have been checked are 
			allowed in. I&#39;ve had enough run-ins with &quot;inventor companies&quot; (both 
			scam artist and patent trolls).<br />
			<br />
			With Oregon experiencing one of it&#39;s worst economic times is 
			decades, I moved back to the Tri-Cities area. What you see is a work 
			in progress, as it should be. <br />

			<ul>
				<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">To 
				promote inventions and intellectual property using the best 
				tools around. Memberships only to reduce the risk of scams and 
				unethical practices. A simple networking method that is created 
				to spark another industrial revolution. Yeah, I dream big.</span>
