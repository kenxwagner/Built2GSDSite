			<h2>About MotormindInc.</h2>
			<p>Want a new job or career, but can&#39;t get your foot in the door, 
			because you don&#39;t have enough &quot;experience&quot;? Have talent that you 
			can&#39;t use because you haven&#39;t done the work with a title? It&#39;s is 
			very frustrating and prevents talented people from doing what they 
			like or doing what they are best at. This site is designed to help 
			with that.</p>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To find work experience through volunteer work and independent 
			contracting for those who seek. Many businesses will accept such 
			work, but it is just the start. Tracking work hours and random 
			testing will be added to help create a quality pool of talent. A 
			secondary hope, is for those interested in pursuing a specific 
			career to be able to try it out (by volunteering) without having to 
			invest time and money only to find out it is the wrong fit.</p>
			<h4>Why?&nbsp;</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p>This is my solution to a problem that has hounded me for 
				many years. I received many accolades for my performance and 
				talents, but without the right circumstances and networking, I 
				could not convert it into a better career. In some cases, I 
				found myself leaving the job because outperforming my superiors.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>I have the ability to change myself and it is something I 
				will leave for others... if they so choose. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>“Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there 
				is no path and leave a trail” - Ralph Waldo Emerson </p>
