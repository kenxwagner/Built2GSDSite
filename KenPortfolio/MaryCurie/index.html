  <p class="hook">When talking about superstars of the science world, one cannot overlook the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. </p>
  
  <p>She was born in Warsaw, Poland with the name of Marie Sk≈Çodowska, on November 7th, 1867. Her father was a distinguished physicist and professer of chemistry, so it is no surprise that she went far with her studies. She moved to Paris where she attained academic degrees in physics (1893) and mathemeatics (1894). Next came a certificate for the secondary instruction of girls (1896), then a 3 year stint as a lecturer (1900-1903). She obtained her doctorate in physics (1903) and later taught at the Univeristy of Paris (1906-1909) and ended up being promoted to professorship of general physics. </p>

    Her orginal path to work as as governess to the daughters of a Russian nobleman was altered with increased scrutiny by the government, so off she went to Paris. It took her some time before she found employment at one of the labs in Paris, which started as trivial prep work. This was enough of a foothold for Marie, because she drew the attection of head of the department, Professor Lippmann. He befriended the girl, and it just so happens that he introduced her to his student, Pierre Curie. She endowed him with a new and intense interest in scientific research, which begat many trophies, awards, and fame."</p>
