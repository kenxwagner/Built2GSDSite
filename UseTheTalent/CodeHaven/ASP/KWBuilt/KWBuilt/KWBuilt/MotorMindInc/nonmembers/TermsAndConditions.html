						respect to the subject matter hereof, and govern your 
						use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements or 
						negotiations between you and us with respect to the 
						subject matter hereof. The Terms and the relationship 
						between you and MotorMindInc shall be governed by the 
						laws of the New York State, without giving effect to any 
						choice of laws principles that would require the 
						application of the laws of a different country or state. 
						Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or 
						relating to the Terms, or your use of, the Services must 
						be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts 
						located in New York County, New York and in no other 
						jurisdiction. You further consent to personal

						failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of 
						the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or

						endeavor to give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as 
						reflected in the provision, and that the other 
						provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. 
						You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the 
						contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or

						materials other than those it has specifically 
						requested. We hope that you will understand that the 
						intent of this policy is to avoid the possibility of 
						future misunderstandings when projects developed by

						similar to creative works submitted by users. 
						Accordingly, while we value your feedback, we must ask 
						that you do not send original creative materials. <o:p></o:p>
